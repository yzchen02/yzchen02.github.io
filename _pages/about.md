I am currently a first-year Master's student at [Tianjin University](https://www.tju.edu.cn/）, supervised by Prof. [Jiale Cao](https://jialecao001.github.io/). I received my B.S. degree from [Central South University](https://www.csu.edu.cn/) in 2024. Previously, I was a research intern at the [iFLYTEK AI Research Institute](https://www.iflytek.com/), where I worked on long-context handwriting generation using diffusion models.

My research interests focus on **Efficient Generative Models**, including Personalized Image Generation and Acceleration of Generative Processes. I am familiar with the theory and implementation of both auto-regressive and diffusion-based generative models. Recently, my work has centered on Flux and acceleration methods for auto-regressive generation.

I’m actively seeking collaborators—please feel free to reach out via Email at ``yzchen@tju.edu.cn``
